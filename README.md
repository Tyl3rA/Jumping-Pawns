# Jumping Pawns

## Usage
  The PvP option in the submenu is local play, the PvE option lets you play against a minimax algorithm. After choosing PvE, you will select a difficulty and a notifcation level submenu. Easy has a depth of 2, Medium has a depth of 3, and Hard has a depth of 4. If Easy is selected, the depth increases to 3 once 10 pawns have reached their target rows. The notifications options are straightfoward, you choose if / how you want to be notified once the AI has made its move whether that be a blink of the LED, a short buzz of the vibro motor, or both.

## How to Play
  Each player starts with 12 pawns in the rows on their side of the board. Your goal is to reach the other side of the board with all of your pawns before your opponent does. Each pawn moves only by jumping vertically or horizontally over other groups of pawns.
