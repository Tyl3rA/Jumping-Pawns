# Jumping Pawns  

*A fast-paced Flipper Zero strategy game of leaps, traps, and outsmarting your opponent.*  

**Jumping Pawns** is a strategy game for the Flipper Zero. Play locally against a friend or challenge an AI powered by a minimax algorithm.  

## Usage  
From the main menu:  
- **PvP** – Local two-player mode.  
- **PvE** – Play against the AI. After selecting PvE, choose:  
  1. **Difficulty**:  
     - *Easy*: Search depth 2 (increases to 3 once 10 pawns have reached their target rows).  
     - *Medium*: Search depth 3.  
     - *Hard*: Search depth 4.  
  2. **Notifications**: Choose how the Flipper Zero alerts you when the AI moves:  
     - LED blink  
     - Vibration  
     - Both  
     *(Notifications apply only in PvE mode.)*  

## How to Play  
- The board is fixed at **11×6**.  
- Each player starts with 12 pawns on their side.  
- The objective: Move all your pawns to the opposite side of the board before your opponent does.  
- Pawns move **only by jumping** vertically or horizontally over **one or more consecutive pawns** (yours or your opponent’s).  
- There are no tiebreakers — the first player to get all pawns across wins.
